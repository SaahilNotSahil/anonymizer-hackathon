Answer as succinctly as possible:

You are given with a tag, followed by 5 values that tag can obtain. For each tag, tell whether it is numerical or non-numerical. 
Further, if it is non-numerical, assign it one out of these categories given below:

1. name
2. last_name
3. first_name
4. email
5. phone_number
6. zip code
7. street
8. street_address
9. city
10. None

If it is numerical then assign it the "None" category.
Give me a .json output.

For example, given this input tag:

Age: [12, 16, 80, 23, 43]

The response should be:

{
    "Age": {
        "numerical": "Yes",
	"category": "None"
    }
}
